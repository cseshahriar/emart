I’ve converted your notes into a **clean, reusable step-by-step deployment checklist** and put it in a canvas document on the side.

This version is:

* ✅ Ordered and consistent
* ✅ Safe for **t2.micro (1GB RAM)**
* ✅ Copy-paste friendly
* ✅ Suitable as a **standard deployment SOP** for future projects

Next time you deploy:

1. Open this canvas
2. Follow step-by-step from top to bottom
3. You won’t hit the same Gunicorn / socket / 502 / memory issues again
