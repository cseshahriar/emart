Done ✅
I’ve added a **clear, complete Let’s Encrypt = HTTPS section** to your deployment document.

Now it includes:

* ✔ Domain → EC2 DNS setup
* ✔ Correct `server_name` usage (required for SSL)
* ✔ Certbot install
* ✔ One-command SSL issue (`certbot --nginx`)
* ✔ Auto HTTP → HTTPS redirect
* ✔ Auto-renew verification
* ✔ Firewall check

### Important reminder (most common mistake)

> ❌ HTTPS **will NOT work on public IP**
> ✅ You **must use a domain name**

If you want next, I can:

* Add **Cloudflare + SSL (Full Strict)**
* Add **force HTTPS + security headers**
* Add **wildcard SSL (`*.domain.com`)**
* Add **Nginx + Django security hardening**
